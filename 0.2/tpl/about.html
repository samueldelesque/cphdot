			<h3>CPH DOT solved our product sourcing quickly and efficiently.</h3>
			<p><blockquote>“In January 2013 we had a strict deadline to source private label products from China, with limited time and manpower. So we turned to Hans Christian from CPH DOT for help. He had the right connections, the expertise and the energy that we needed.</blockquote></p><p class="right-text"><a href="/about/volt-case" id="voltCaseBtn" class="small">read more [+]</a></p><br/>

			<div class="why">
			<h3>Why?</h3>
			<p><b>“Why is it so hard to make the simple things simple?</b> When I was a buyer dealing with China on a daily basis or working out of China, it always baffled me how something simple, sometimes became complicated by ways of misunderstanding and partners in China that did not care. It costs the same to make a bad product as it does to make a good one. All it takes is a real interest in the product!</p>
			<br/>
			<p>This is why I started CPH DOT and chose to work with one of the best trade houses in Hong Kong. I take price in my products and I know the Scandinavian way of thinking, and the Chinese and Hong Kong way of working.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>My job is to make sure everything flows and to develop new products and private labels together with my clients and my partners – and I love every minute of it.</p>
