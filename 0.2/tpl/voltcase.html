<div class="hero"><h1 class="quote">CPH DOT solved our product sourcing quickly and efficiently.</h1></div>
<p><blockquote>“In January 2013 we had a strict deadline to source private label products from China, with limited time and manpower. So we turned to Hans Christian from CPH DOT for help. He had the right connections, the expertise and the energy that we needed.<br/>
<br/> 
Hans Christian travelled to China, made the relevant arrangements and negotiated the prices and terms. With product development underway, he also shared his strategies and knowledge in the field, so we ended up learning a lot more about sourcing and buying from China and Europe, along with knowledge about the required CE tests and standards. <br/>
<br/>
By May 2013, our first products were in stock, and our first two sales containers were ready. And by end of September our team had been to 19 festivals, and helped 40.000 customers with “power to go!” It would have been tough to do, without the hard work of Hans Christian and his vast network of experienced professionals in Denmark and abroad.<br/>
 <br/>
Hans Christian’s positive energy, his determined can-do attitude, extended knowledge of product design, sourcing and development, and his network of great people, was a huge help to us exactly when we needed it! Thank you for a great start!”
